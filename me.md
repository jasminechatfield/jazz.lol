## Hello, I am Jasmine or Jazz.

### I'm a writer, performer and event host based in Manchester, UK. I'm also a web developer!

I have a phobia of slugs, and mushrooms that grow in the ground. I'm mildly afraid of doors.

This website is still under construction. I'll be back to it. Please have a browse!
