## I make immersive performances that are strange, engaging and fun.

### I've made work in comedy, theatre and spoken word.

#### FLIM NITE

A FLIM is a film retold live on stage by comedians, writers, performers, dancers, musicians, and performers of all kinds.

FLIM NITE is also an cult experimental pop-culture cabaret night that was founded by myself and Jack Nicholls in Manchester in 2015. We run regular events in Sheffield, Newcastle and London, and have created special one-offs for a number of festivals across the country.

_"The group take a hammer to well-known films and smash them into something completely different – think a smorgasbord of musical interludes, a dab of poetry and an added bit of standup comedy. Trust us; it’s unlike any other night around!"_ - The Skinny
​
_"With all the ramshackle pop-anarchism of Never Mind The Buzzcocks and the warmth, variety and bonhomie of a fringe arts night, FLIM NITE is going from strength to strength and is not to be missed."_ - NARC Magazine

_“There is almost a managed anarchy where anything could happen but you never feel that things are out of control: a very difficult feat to achieve.”_ – Kieren King, Evidently

_“FLIM NITE's extra charm comes from a sense of fearless confidence, honest experimentalism and refreshing changes of style.”_ – Martin Palmer, review

_“Jack and Jasmine host with a laid back, high energy quality that carries the whole event and fosters a lovely rapport between the performers and audience … a great platform for seasoned and emerging writers alike.”_ – The Short Story

_“FLIM NITE is about how we process our screen worship, as well as how we might chuckle at it.”_ – Eminent Youth Journal

_"If you’ve never been to FLIM NITE, GO!"_ - Manchester Wire

#### Clonely

Clonely was a two-man show created by myself and Charlie Hammond in 2017. We took it to the Edinburgh Fringe for a month and on a short tour to Manchester, Newcastle, Leicester and London.

The loose plot follows the birth of two identical clones aboard a spaceship on a course to nowhere, and their subsequent discoveries about the nature of their existence, the untimely fates of their predecessors and their creator, wealthy tech entrepeneur Don Solus.

With a soundtrack of predominantly Julian Cope, dance-dream sequences starring an unknown scorpion deity, plenty of existential dread and "the most chaste-yet-raunchy sci-fi sex scene of the Fringe" (The Scotsman), Clonely was a chaotic and underrated success.

_"Chatfield and Hammond are gifted physical comedians, conveying multitudes with a fixed grin and a flick of the eyes; the scene where they become familiar with their newly discovered bodies is an extended, dialogue-free delight. Other highlights include the most chaste-yet-raunchy sci-fi sex scene of the Fringe, and a glorious montage of death."_ - The Scotsman (\*\*\*\*)

_"The show is a failure"_ - The Scotsman (\*\*\*\*)

_"I defy anyone not to be completely taken with this show. This sweet, creative piece of theatre will give you more belly laughs than expected, and should be applauded for its originality."_ - Ed Fest Mag (\*\*\*\*)
