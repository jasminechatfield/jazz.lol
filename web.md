## I'm a developer who likes making creative, accessible and simple websites.

### I like making websites for creative individuals, projects and small businesses.

I can also make apps, software and... I don't know, probably anything you can think of, to varying degrees of success.

Does anyone look at personal websites anymore? I do. Sometimes they're glorified business cards. They can be a useful place to dump information you think other people might need, and that's a great use.

But they can also be a special place on the internet you can put anything you want. Remember the good old days of Geocities? I'd like to herald a movement away from bland and (crucially) unpersonalisable social media profiles and back towards special-interest websites, niche cacophanies of every little interest of one person, all in one place. We have Wix and Squarespace now, but personalising these away from a preset cookie-cutter style is actually quite difficult, and they lack the ability to hide any little easter eggs for discerning viewers.

I thought about making this website more professional, but then I had a lot of fun making this silly design which started as a half-arsed mock-up, grew very fond of it, and couldn't bring myself to make a nicer one.

Anyway, if I make as website for you, it can be as silly or professional as you want. Or something else, those aren't the only options. Just get in touch with a brief idea of what you want (even if that's 'I want to impress [my crush]'\* or 'I want it to be pink') and an idea of budget (what's your income? what can you reasonably afford?) and I'll tell you if it's possible.

Oh no I just finished writing this and realised I should mention what skills I have in case any bigwigs are looking at this. Oh no.
