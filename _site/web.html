<h3 id="i-like-making-websites-for-creative-individuals-projects-and-small-businesses">I like making websites for creative individuals, projects and small businesses.</h3>

<p>I can also make apps, software and… I don’t know, probably anything you can think of, to varying degrees of success.</p>

<p>Does anyone look at personal websites anymore? I do. Sometimes they’re glorified business cards. They can be a useful place to dump information you think other people might need, and that’s a great use.</p>

<p>But they can also be a special place on the internet you can put anything you want. Remember the good old days of Geocities? I’d like to herald a movement away from bland and (crucially) unpersonalisable social media profiles and back towards special-interest websites, niche cacophanies of every little interest of one person, all in one place. We have Wix and Squarespace now, but personalising these away from a preset cookie-cutter style is actually quite difficult, and they lack the ability to hide any little easter eggs for discerning viewers.</p>

<p>I thought about making this website more professional, but then I had a lot of fun making this silly design which started as a half-arsed mock-up, grew very fond of it, and couldn’t bring myself to make a nicer one.</p>

<p>Anyway, if I make as website for you, it can be as silly or professional as you want. Or something else, those aren’t the only options. Just get in touch with a brief idea of what you want (even if that’s ‘I want to impress [my crush]’* or ‘I want it to be pink’) and an idea of budget (what’s your income? what can you reasonably afford?) and I’ll tell you if it’s possible.</p>

<p>Oh no I just finished writing this and realised I should mention what skills I have in case any bigwigs are looking at this. Oh no.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<h3 id="react-javascript-html-css-photoshop">React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Photoshop</h3>

<p>Flutter,</p>

<h2 id="things-im-working-on">Things I’m working on</h2>

<h3 id="that-im-pretty-sure-i-can-pick-up">that I’m pretty sure I can pick up</h3>

<p>I know a tiny bit of C# and Ruby. I’m learning Unity to make games.</p>

<p>* or simply message me to tell me who your crush is. I love gossip.</p>
