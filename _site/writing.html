<p>I would like to write novels. I’m trying!!!</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Elvira Hernández’ detainment and torture for five days by the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in 1979 was accidental, a case of mistaken identity, but in the years that followed the regime continued to monitor her. Feeling watched, Hernández (real name María Teresa Adriasola) wrote <em>La bandera de Chile</em>, a poem that eschews the personal in favour of the collective and that spoke to the heart of oppression in Chile. For a decade, the poem was mimeographed and passed around, before finally being published more widely in 1991 after the end of the Pinochet regime.</p>
