  <h4 id="review-of-the-chilean-flag-by-elvira-hernndez-translated-by-alec-schumacher-kenning-editions-2019">review of The Chilean Flag by Elvira Hernández, translated by Alec Schumacher, Kenning Editions, 2019</h4>

  <p>The flag was originally a symbol of the country’s independence from Spanish rule. That the flag came to be used against the population is a common form of political control. Schumacher draws a comparison between how the Chilean flag became a tool for oppression, and how black US athletes today can lose their jobs for refusing to stand for the national anthem – in both cases, patriotism is used against citizens to bend them to the will of the ruling class. In the UK, the British flag has become somewhat synonymous with the Leave campaign, supporters of ‘Brexit’ and the rise of nationalism and fascism in the country. Symbols of unity too easily become corrupted and used against the people they represent.</p>

  <p>my dear gurgle                    sweet hyena</p>

  <p>you always purr            before you roar</p>

  <p>clean and lonely                     never full</p>

  <p>it just rolls out of me               like rage</p>

  <p>you are just air        in the wrong place</p>

  <p>emptiness but    the opposite of space</p>
