## I like to write

### poems, short stories, novels, scripts, essays and reviews.

I've had a few things published and won a Northern Writers Award in 2017.

I have also worked as a copywriter and funding bid writer.

I'm currently working on two poetry pamphlets, one called Stomachfoot about being a slug and having a horrible body, and one called Electric Goblin Constellation about being a human and having a horrible brain.

I would like to write novels. I'm trying!!!

I've written a few book reviews and I'd like to write more. I'm also available to write about queer/trans stuff, science fiction in TV and literature, relationships, nuclear apocalypses.

### [The Chilean Flag Forces Herself to be More than a Flag](https://www.modernpoetryintranslation.com/the-chilean-flag-forces-herself-to-be-more-than-a-flag/){:target="\_blank"}

#### [review of The Chilean Flag by Elvira Hernández, translated by Alec Schumacher, Kenning Editions, 2019](https://www.modernpoetryintranslation.com/the-chilean-flag-forces-herself-to-be-more-than-a-flag/){:target="\_blank"}

> Elvira Hernández’ detainment and torture for five days by the military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet in 1979 was accidental, a case of mistaken identity, but in the years that followed the regime continued to monitor her. Feeling watched, Hernández (real name María Teresa Adriasola) wrote _La bandera de Chile_, a poem that eschews the personal in favour of the collective and that spoke to the heart of oppression in Chile. For a decade, the poem was mimeographed and passed around, before finally being published more widely in 1991 after the end of the Pinochet regime.
