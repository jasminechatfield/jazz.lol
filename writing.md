## I write poems, short stories, novels, scripts, essays and reviews.

### I've had a few things published and won a Northern Writers Award in 2017.

I have also worked as a copywriter and funding bid writer.

I'm currently working on two poetry pamphlets, one called Stomachfoot about being a slug and having a horrible body, and one called Electric Goblin Constellation about being a human and having a horrible brain.

I would like to write novels. I'm trying!!!

I've written a few book reviews and I'd like to write more. I'm also available to write about queer/trans stuff, science fiction in TV and literature, relationships, nuclear apocalypses.

### The Chilean Flag Forces Herself to be More than a Flag

#### review of The Chilean Flag by Elvira Hernández, translated by Alec Schumacher, Kenning Editions, 2019

The flag was originally a symbol of the country’s independence from Spanish rule. That the flag came to be used against the population is a common form of political control. Schumacher draws a comparison between how the Chilean flag became a tool for oppression, and how black US athletes today can lose their jobs for refusing to stand for the national anthem – in both cases, patriotism is used against citizens to bend them to the will of the ruling class. In the UK, the British flag has become somewhat synonymous with the Leave campaign, supporters of ‘Brexit’ and the rise of nationalism and fascism in the country. Symbols of unity too easily become corrupted and used against the people they represent.

### Throat Thing

#### micro-collection published by Rinky Dink Press

my dear gurgle &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sweet hyena

you always purr &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before you roar

clean and lonely &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;never full

it just rolls out of me &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like rage

you are just air &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the wrong place

emptiness but &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the opposite of space

### 3 poems

#### Neon Magazine

Baby teeth were never lost

but others nestled in the hollows

### Poland in Russia in England

#### poem in NOUS magazine

As heat sources they kept rovers warm on the moon.

The green tea, when delivered to me, was already cold.
